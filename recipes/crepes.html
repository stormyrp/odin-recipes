        <p>
            A very thin flat cake, similar to a pancake, that is served as a base for a variety of sweet toppings. Special pans, either flat bottom or rounded bottom, are designed for making crêpes, but a small heavy skillet can also be used if the surface is clean, very smooth and well seasoned. The pan is heated to a hot temperature, then allowed to cool to a medium temperature before the batter is added.
